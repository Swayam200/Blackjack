A Blackjack game I made using Python!

You can try the game here - https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack

# How to play ?
Just download the blackjack.py file and you are all set! Run it directly. No external libraries required! :)

# My Blackjack game rules
The deck is unlimited in size.
There are no jokers.
The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
The Ace can count as 11 or 1.
Use the following list as the deck of cards:
cards = 11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10

The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
The computer is the dealer.

# Flowchart

There's a flowchart attached showing the logic used for the program.

# Credits
This project was made during my completion of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Code BootCamp.
However, the code logic is completely mine along with the flowchart diagram which I've prepared from scratch.

Thank you :)
